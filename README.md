## Introduction

This is my personal portfolio website built with React. The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, and experience to potential employers, and collaborators. 

## Features

- **Home**: An introduction to who I am and what I do.
- **About**: A brief overview of my background, skills, and interests.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my completed and ongoing projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and source code.
- **Contact**: A form to get in touch with me directly.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation within the app.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
- **Styled-components**: For styling the components.
- **FontAwesome**: For icons.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd react-portfolio
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm start
```
This will launch the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

To build the app for production, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` folder.
